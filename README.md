# Airflow_MVP
Implementing Apache Airflow Best Practices for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

Establishing a new Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) encapsulates a tripartite procedure:

1. **Code Inscription**: 
   - Compose Python script to instantiate a DAG object.
   - Adhere to Pythonic principles - PEP 8 standards, for code readability and maintainability.
   - Employ task dependencies judiciously to ensure coherent task execution order.
   - Utilize XCom for inter-task communication, albeit sparingly, to maintain acyclic graph property.
   - Integrate idempotency and atomicity principles within task designs to ensure reliable and reproducible task executions.
   - Modularize code by encapsulating common routines within Python functions or custom operators.

2. **Code Verification**:
   - Utilize `airflow test` command to ascertain task execution functionality.
   - Employ `airflow render` command to validate Jinja template rendering for task parameters.
   - Utilize unit testing frameworks such as `pytest` along with `unittest.mock` for mocking external dependencies.
   - Validate DAG integrity with `airflow check` command to ensure absence of cycle in task dependencies.

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Configure necessary environment variables, e.g., `AIRFLOW_HOME`, `AIRFLOW__CORE__DAGS_FOLDER`, etc., to orientate Airflow setup.
   - Establish necessary connections, variables and pools within the Airflow UI or through CLI.
   - Utilize Docker or Kubernetes for containerization to ensure a consistent environment for DAG execution.
   - Configure logging settings to capture essential diagnostics for task executions.
   - Ensure requisite Python dependencies are satisfied within the execution environment.
